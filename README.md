# Machine Learning Algorithms for Damage Detection
* The project was built in collaboration with Dr. KS Raju, CEERI Pilani
* Involves the use of Time Series Accelarator Data for prediction of Health of a Civil Structure.
* Various Unsupervised Machine Leanring Algorithms are analysed on 3 story aluminium frame dataset
* Algorithms ar OneClassSVM, Support Vector Data Description (SVDD), Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), Greedy Kernel Principal Analysis(GKPCA)
